A beginner SwiftUI design practice project with dark/light mode, system-based localization, and a custom icon.
# 🍕 SwiftUI Design Practice – Bootcamp Project

This is a basic SwiftUI interface design practice project I built during a bootcamp.  
It focuses on learning core concepts like system appearance, localization, and layout building.
📱 Features
- 🌗 Light & Dark Mode support  
- 🌍 Localization based on system language (Turkish / English)  
- 🍕 Custom pizza-themed UI layout  
- 🖼️ Custom App Icon  
- 🧪 Basic interface-only flow, no real backend logic
- 
🎯 Purpose
This project was part of a bootcamp where the goal was to explore SwiftUI’s capabilities for designing interfaces.

There are no advanced data structures, state management, or closures involved intentionally — this is a UI-focused sandbox project.
